# Example Notebooks - Moved to Separate Repo

## Overview

The example notebooks that were previously part of this repository have now been moved to a separate repository for better organization and maintainability. 

You can find the example notebooks in the new repository:

[**`polsartools` Example Notebooks**](https://github.com/Narayana-Rao/polsartools-notebooks)

In this new repository, youâ€™ll find various Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the package and its features.

## How to Access

To access the example notebooks:

1. Visit the [Example Notebooks Repo](https://github.com/Narayana-Rao/polsartools-notebooks).
2. Clone the repository or view the notebooks directly in GitHub.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to get started with the package.

## Installation Requirements

To run the notebooks, you will need to install the core package. You can do so by:

### 1. Install **`gdal`** Package

```bash
conda install gdal -c conda-forge
```

### 2. Install **`polsartools`** Package

Before running the notebooks, you'll need to install the core **`polsartools`** package. 

You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install polsartools
```

If you encounter an error like "function not found" or need the latest version, you can install the updated version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Narayana-Rao/polsartools.git#egg=polsartools
```
