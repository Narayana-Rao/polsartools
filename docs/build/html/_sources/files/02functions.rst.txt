Functions
=========

Full-pol functions
-------------------
Full-pol functionalities require the SAR data in the form of scattering (S2), covariance (C3) or coherency matrix (T3). 
A typical file structures of S2, T3 and C3 matrices are provded in: 

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    functions/dataFP

Following are the avaialble functions for full-pol data:
